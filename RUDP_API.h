* @note This function is taken from RFC1071, can be found here:
* @note https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1071
* @note It is the simplest way to calculate a checksum and is not very strong.
* However, it is good enough for this assignment.
* @note You are free to use any other checksum function as well.
* You can also use this function as such without any change.
